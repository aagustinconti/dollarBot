## It is important to be curious and learn with your own means.
There is no more rewarding than being able to answer a question you used to say 'oh, how does this work?'
and to be able to do it alone (although there is always help from people who know more than one).
I repeat, the important thing is the initiative!


* Heroku:
The deploy could be done thanks to Heroku (you need to set the environment variables there). Heroku (https://www.heroku.com) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

* For create a new app on Twitter
You need to go to this link --> https://developer.twitter.com

* requirements.txt:
After configuring the language in which it is going to work, we must add all the requirements that are needed for our app to work, all the modules used so that our environment where the application is executed has the necessary resources for it. To do this we can follow the excellently detailed steps that the Heroku platform leaves us. It is full of useful and concise information!

* Procfile:
This is a file that Heroku needs to know which of all our files is the main one, in my case it is coretwitterBot.py
the file that Heroku must execute.


* Fonts:
Programming this was not the most difficult but the search for information was the most complicated. I learned a lot by doing this and I have extracted information from many YouTube videos and internet forums. To my liking there is too much information everywhere and easy to consult.

* Scraping:
The data extraction was from the page dolarhoy.com
